> 🔐 **Note**: You may need to **log in** to Loom the first time. Once logged in, adjust playback speed (1x, 1.5x, 2x) as needed to explore the demo at your pace.  
> 📁 File handling features (document upload by users & download by admins) were not shown in the video, as screen recording tools can’t capture file manager popups or download dialogs due to company security policies. However, these features are fully implemented and working as expected — you can verify them in the source code.
